# riboswitch-combinations
Prints out combinations of sequences from the test files
Right now the main problem is that so far we don't have an offical format of the excel files. So I might have to change this code depending on the rules we set for the user and what they can and can't put in their excel files
Also, not completely sure what the input for the subscripts we will call with this script, either being entire excel files or just the sequences. But other than that, pretty simple script with some comments to help along
Most likely very unoptimized, am a beginner to the language after all so any helpful comments/changes will be apreciated
